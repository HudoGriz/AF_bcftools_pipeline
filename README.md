# BCFtools-Pipeline (Nextflow DSL2)

This repository contains a **Nextflow DSL2 pipeline** for **SNP** variant calling quality control (QC) and downstream allele frequency annotation stratified by sex and ancestry.  

It integrates several QC steps (genotype-, variant-, and sample-level filtering) and recalculates allele frequencies (AFs) based on sample metadata using BCFTools. 



## Workflow Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **INDEX_VCF**  
   - Ensures each input VCF has an index (`.tbi`).  
   - If missing, it creates one with `tabix`.

2. **SPLIT_MULTIALLELIC**  
   - Splits multiallelic variants into biallelic records using `bcftools norm`.

3. **GENOTYPE_QC**  
   - Masks low-quality genotypes (`./.`) according to thresholds:
     - Genotype Quality (GQ)
     - Depth of Coverage (DP)
     - Allelic Depth ratio (AD)  
   - Automatically detects if FORMAT tags exist before applying filters.

4. **VARIANT_QC**  
   - Filters out low-quality variants based on INFO and QUAL fields.  
   - Supported filters: QUAL, QD, DP, MQ, FS, ReadPosRankSum.

5. **SAMPLE_QC**  
   - Removes samples failing quality thresholds:
     - Mean coverage
     - Call rate
     - Het/Hom ratio
     - Number of singletons
     - Contamination (using [sceVCF](https://github.com/HTGenomeAnalysisUnit/SCE-VCF))  

   **Thresholds differ depending on `seq_type` (WES vs WGS).**

6. **ADD_AF**  
   - Uses a metadata CSV file to define groups (sex + ancestry).  
   - Annotates the final VCF with total and group-specific allele frequencies.

## Technical requirements 

- [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html) ≥ 24.04

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/es/java/technologies/downloads/) ≥ 17

- [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/install.html) ≥ 1.10

- [tabix](https://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) (htslib) ≥ 1.13

- [sceVCF binaries](https://github.com/HTGenomeAnalysisUnit/SCE-VCF/releases/tag/v0.1.3) for contamination checks

## Input Requirements

- **VCF files** (`.vcf.gz`) in the input directory.  

    ⚠️ **Important: For allele frequency (AF) recalculations to be valid, the input VCFs should contain only unrelated individuals.**

- **Index files** (`.tbi`) [OPTIONAL], will be created if missing.  
- **Metadata CSV** with columns SAMPLE_ID, SEX and ANCESTRY.

    Example: 
    ```
    SAMPLE,SEX,ANCESTRY
    sample1,1,EUR
    sample2,2,AFR
    sample3,1,EAS
    ```
    **Some important considerations about the submitted metadata:** 
    
    - Ensure the order of your metadata columns is the one shown above.
    - Sex should be coded as `1` = MALE, `2` = FEMALE.  
    - Ancestry codes are free-text (e.g., EUR, AFR, EAS). But, take into consideration that the naming on the CSV will be used to annotate the ancestry AF fields in the VCF. 


- **sceVCF binary path** 

## Configuration 

Edit *nextflow.config* to adjust parameters. 

```groovy
params {
    // Paths
    input        = "/path/to/folder/with/vcfs/"
    output_stats = "/home/mireia/GitHub/bcftools-pipeline/bcftools-pipeline"
    sceVCF_path  = "/path/to/sceVCF_binaries"
    metadata_csv = "/path/to/metadata.csv"  // sample/sex/ancestry
    seq_type     = "WGS" // or "WES"
    threads      = 4

     // Pipeline behavior
    seq_type     = 'WGS' // or 'WES'
    threads      = 4

     // -----------------------
    // QC Thresholds
    // -----------------------
    qc {

        // Genotype QC defaults 
        genotype {
        gq_threshold         = 20
        dp_threshold         = 10
        ad_ratio_threshold   = 0.2
        }

        // Variant QC defaults
        variant {
        qual_threshold                 = 30
        qd_threshold                   = 2.0
        dp_threshold                   = 10
        mq_threshold                   = 40
        fs_threshold                   = 60
        read_pos_rank_sum_threshold    = -8.0
        }

        // Sample QC (choose set via `seq_type`)
        sample {
        // Whole-Exome defaults
        wes {
            coverage_threshold       = 10
            het_hom_threshold        = 10
            call_rate_threshold      = 0.95
            singletons_threshold     = 5000
            contamination_threshold  = 0.00015
        }
        // Whole-Genome defaults
        wgs {
            coverage_threshold       = 15
            het_hom_threshold        = 3.3
            call_rate_threshold      = 0.95
            singletons_threshold     = 100000
            contamination_threshold  = 0.05
        }
        }
    }
}

```
**Notes**

- `seq_type` selects which Sample QC thresholds are applied (wes vs wgs).

- metadata_csv is required.

- The fields INFO/QD, INFO/DP, INFO/MQ, INFO/FS, INFO/ReadPosRankSum,  FORMAT/GQ, FORMAT/GT and FORMAT/AD must be correctly described in the header for the filtering to work correctly.

## Running the Pipeline

### Basic run: 

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```

### With custom parameters

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
  --input "/data/vcfs/" \
  --metadata_csv "/data/metadata.csv" \
  --sceVCF_path "/tools/sceVCF" \
  --seq_type "WGS" \
  --threads 8
```

**NOTE:** This will overwrite the configuration parameters set in nextflow.config

### HTML report and timeline

```
nextflow run main.nf -with-report report.html -with-timeline timeline.html
```

This command will automatically generate two reports, report.html and timeline.html. 

**report.html** will contain: 

- Process run counts and statuses (cached/failed/succeeded)

- CPU, memory, time usage per process

- I/O stats and container info (if used)

- Cache hit ratio and overall runtime

**timeline.html** will contain:

- Each task’s start/finish times

- Parallelism and queueing

- Retries/restarts and durations


## Outputs 

After a successful execution, you'll find inside the */work* folder:

**Intermediate outputs**

- Indexed VCFs (.tbi)

- Split multiallelic VCFs

- Masked genotypes VCFs

- Variant-filtered and masked genotypes VCFs

- Variant and Sample-filtered with masked genotypes VCFs

- sample-qc-fails.tsv file with the samples deleted and which filter step failed

**Final output**

* *input_vcf_baseName*.vcf.gz (TODO: make the name the same as the original VCF with -AF_recalc) → fully filtered VCF with allele frequency annotations and witout sample level information. 

- *input_vcf_baseName*.vcf.gz.tbi → index for the final VCF.

- In `$output_stats` there will be a log file with information about each step of the pipeline run per file.

💡 **How to find the files inside the /work folder?**

Example a of nextflow output: 

```
[34/34b365] process > INDEX_VCF (test.vcf.bgz)                                           [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[bc/56f27a] process > SPLIT_MULTIALLELIC (test.vcf.bgz)                                  [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[46/bf10e7] process > GENOTYPE_QC (test_split-multiallelic.vcf.bgz)                      [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[88/8b101c] process > VARIANT_QC (test_split-multiallelic-masked.vcf.gz)                 [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[33/a6c930] process > SAMPLE_QC (test_split-multiallelic-masked-filtered.vcf.gz)         [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
[c7/065171] process > ADD_AF (test_split-multiallelic-masked-filtered.sample_qc.vcf.bgz) [100%] 1 of 1 ✔
```

The intermediate files are saved inside the nextflow folder for each step. 

Go to /work/bc/56f27a[-->] and you'll find the VCF with the multiallelic variants splitted.

Go to /work/33/a6c930[-->] and you'll find all the intermediate files created during the sample QC.

Go to /work/c7/065171[-->] for the final files of the pipeline. 

**Recomendation:** Use at least the argument `-with-report report.html`, this will always show you the folders where the files have been saved.

## How to generate metadata for the samples

Three categories of metadata are required per sample to accurately calculate allele frequencies: sex, ancestry, and relatedness. If you don't have this metadata available there are several tools that can infer it using the genomic data. 

Two examples that have been tested and have good accuracy are [GRAF tools](https://github.com/ncbi/graf) and [Hail](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/index.html). 

### Graf tools
GRAF provides functions to infer sex (`graf sex`, PLINK input), detect related samples (`graf rel`, PLINK input), and assign ancestry ([graf anc](https://github.com/jimmy-penn/grafanc/tree/master), VCF input). Note that, for ancestry inference, only super-population calls (e.g. European, Asian, African...) are recommended, since finer-level predictions are not sufficiently accurate. 

### Hail
Hail offers similar capabilities with `impute_sex` for sex inference and `king` and `pc_relate` for [relatedness filtering](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/guides/genetics.html#remove-related-individuals-from-a-dataset). Another interesting feature is `maximal_independent_set` which outputs the largest subset of unrelated individuals from a dataset.
